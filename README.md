## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains a technical audit of the **COMPAS Recidivism Dataset**, a notorious case study in algorithmic bias. The goal of this project is to use data science tools to quantify racial disparities in risk assessment algorithms and propose ethical remediation strategies.

This work addresses the critical question: **"Does the algorithm make mistakes equally across different demographic groups?"**
