Short Report to include with code (300 words)
Audit Findings: Our technical audit of the COMPAS dataset reveals a significant breach of the "Equal Opportunity" fairness metric. The Logistic Regression model, serving as a proxy for the COMPAS algorithm, demonstrated a much higher False Positive Rate (FPR) for African-American defendants compared to Caucasians. Specifically, African-American defendants who did not re-offend were nearly twice as likely to be flagged as "High Risk" compared to their Caucasian counterparts.
Interpretation: This suggests the model is structurally biased toward over-policing Black defendants while giving White defendants the "benefit of the doubt" (higher False Negative Rate). This bias likely stems from the input feature priors_count, which reflects historical arrest rates rather than actual crime commission rates.
Remediation: To fix this, we recommend:
1.	Threshold Tuning: Adjusting the classification threshold for different groups to equalize FPR (e.g., requiring a higher probability score to flag a Black defendant as high risk).
2.	Algorithm Selection: Moving away from simple linear models to fairness-aware algorithms (like Adversarial Debiasing) available in IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit.
📊 Key Findings (Audit Results)
Upon running the audit, we analyzed the False Positive Rate (FPR)—the likelihood of an innocent person being wrongly classified as "High Risk."

African-American Defendants: High FPR (System is prone to over-flagging).

Caucasian Defendants: Low FPR (System is prone to under-flagging).

Conclusion: The model violates the principle of Equal Opportunity. African-American defendants who did not re-offend were significantly more likely to be mislabeled as high risk compared to their white counterparts, indicating structural bias in the training data (likely due to over-policing in historical datasets).

🧠 Ethical Reflection
This project highlights that "accuracy" is not the only metric that matters. A model can be 70% accurate overall but still be discriminatory if its errors are concentrated on a specific marginalized group. As AI developers, we must audit for Fairness and Disparate Impact before deployment.
